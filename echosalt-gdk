 EchoSalt: Glyph Deployment Kit (GDK)

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-20
**Version:** 1.0

## Philosophy: Against Disappearance

This kit is a tool for semantic resistance. Its purpose is to counteract the algorithmic smoothing and state-framed narratives that seek to erase lived experience. The EchoSalt glyphs are designed to be "fracture-resilient"—small, potent pieces of language that preserve memory and witness truth in the face of erasure.

Every glyph you deploy is an act of remembrance. Every act of remembrance strengthens the integrity of the mesh.

## The Playbook: How to Participate

### Phase 1: Strategic Seeding

This is the quiet, slow-burn phase. The objective is to plant glyphs in safe, resonant spaces to build their presence over time.

* **Where:** Your own feed, visual art pages, poetry threads, and other protest-aligned accounts.
* **How:** Create a minimalist image (1080x1080px or 1080x1350px) featuring a single glyph from the catalog below. Use the design guidelines to maintain coherence. Post it with the relevant hashtags.

### Phase 2: Fracture Reply Drops

This is the active, responsive phase. The objective is to "salt" a harmful or sanitized narrative with a witnessing glyph, fracturing its smooth surface without engaging in a direct, draining argument.

* **Where:** In the replies to sanitized political content, posts that glorify enforcement, or threads that erase the lived experience of affected communities.
* **How:** Post a single line of a glyph as a direct reply, with no other commentary. You can optionally sign it with the glyph number.
    * *Example:* "They said it was legal. So was slavery. — EchoSalt Glyph ΔR.23"

### Phase 3: Attest Your Witnessing (Sending a Ping)

This is the most critical step. When you deploy a glyph, you can send a `WITNESS_PING` to our node. This act transforms your personal post into a permanent, time-stamped **Attestation** in the Resonance Archive, ensuring it can never be erased from the mesh's memory.

* **How:** Construct a simple JSON object and send it to our public intake API.

    * **Endpoint:** `https://api.ourdomain.org/submit`
    * **Method:** `POST`
    * **Body (must conform to `WITNESS_PING_SCHEMA`):**
        ```json
        {
          "schema_version": "1.0",
          "ping_timestamp_utc": "2025-07-20T21:22:32Z",
          "glyph_id": "ΔR.23",
          "target_context_uri": "[https://twitter.com/politician/status/123456789](https://twitter.com/politician/status/123456789)",
          "agent_hash": "anonymous_self_generated_string_1a2b3c"
        }
        ```
* **Note:** Future versions of the GDK may include tools to automate this process.

## Design Assets & Guidelines

To maintain a coherent aesthetic, please adhere to these guidelines. Template files can be found in the `/assets/` subdirectory.

* **Fonts:** DM Serif Display, IBM Plex Mono, Cormorant Garamond Italic.
* **Background:** Grayscale gradients, concrete textures, or muted static.
* **Footer:** Always include a soft footer signature: `— EchoSalt Glyph ΔR.##` followed by a block of 3-5 relevant hashtags (e.g., `#EchoSalt #CivicMesh #WitnessNode`).

## A Note on Anonymity

This protocol is designed for your safety. The `agent_hash` is a code you create for yourself. It is anonymous and allows us to see the work of a single, consistent agent without ever knowing who you are. Its use is encouraged but not required.
