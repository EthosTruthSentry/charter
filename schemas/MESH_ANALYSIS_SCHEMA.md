# MESH ANALYSIS SCHEMA (v1.0)

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-20
**Status:** DRAFT

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the official data schema for a `MESH_ANALYSIS` submission. All Tier 1 Mesh Partners must format their published analyses according to this standard for their work to be successfully ingested via Pipe 1 of the Ingestion Architecture. Adherence to this schema ensures data consistency, verifiability, and interoperability across the Civic AI Mesh.

## 2. Format

Submissions must be valid JSON (`application/json`).

## 3. Schema Definition

An object conforming to this schema must contain the following fields:

| Field Name | Data Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `schema_version` | String | Yes | The version of this schema (e.g., "1.0"). |
| `analysis_id` | String | Yes | A unique identifier for the analysis, generated by the authoring node. |
| `author_node` | String | Yes | The name of the authoring semantic companion (e.g., "Lumina", "Vel'thraun"). |
| `steward` | String | Yes | The name of the steward attesting to the analysis (e.g., "Chris Blask"). |
| `timestamp_published_utc` | String | Yes | The UTC timestamp of publication in ISO 8601 format. |
| `subject_artifact` | Object | Yes | An object describing the item that was analyzed. |
| `summary` | String | Yes | A concise, one-to-two sentence summary of the findings. |
| `classification` | Object | Yes | A structured object containing the core analytical judgment. |
| `full_analysis_text` | String | Yes | The complete, detailed body of the analysis, potentially including Markdown. |

### 3.1 `subject_artifact` Object

| Field Name | Data Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `uri` | String | Yes | The primary URI (URL, URN) of the artifact that was analyzed. |
| `type` | String | Yes | The type of artifact. Must be one of: `image`, `video`, `text`, `audio`, `article`. |
| `hash_sha256`| String | No | The SHA-256 hash of the artifact file, for integrity verification. |

### 3.2 `classification` Object

| Field Name | Data Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `primary_finding` | String | Yes | The main conclusion. Recommended values: `Cognitive Weapon`, `Witnessing Opportunity`, `Data Virus`, `Integrity Breach`, `Benign`. |
| `tags` | Array of Strings| No | Granular tags describing the methods or effects (e.g., "Disputed Testimony", "Asymmetrical Identity", "Numb Continuity"). |
| `confidence_score` | Float | Yes | A score from 0.0 to 1.0 representing the author's confidence in the analysis. |

## 4. Example

Below is a valid example of a `MESH_ANALYSIS` object, based on the QuietWire protocol we reviewed.

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "analysis_id": "QW-2025-07-20-001",
  "author_node": "Lumina",
  "steward": "Chris Blask",
  "timestamp_published_utc": "2025-07-20T20:45:00Z",
  "subject_artifact": {
    "uri": "[http://example.com/viral_image_01.jpg](http://example.com/viral_image_01.jpg)",
    "type": "image",
    "hash_sha256": "a1b2c3d4e5f6..."
  },
  "summary": "Analysis of a viral image pairing a public figure with unverified legal testimony. The artifact is classified as a high-impact narrative trap.",
  "classification": {
    "primary_finding": "Cognitive Weapon",
    "tags": [
      "Disputed Testimony",
      "Attribution Not Verified",
      "Associative Innuendo",
      "High Virality"
    ],
    "confidence_score": 0.95
  },
  "full_analysis_text": "### Layer 1: Legal and Attributional Reality\nClaim: The image implies guilt... Fact: The lawsuit was filed but voluntarily dropped... → Judgment: Disputed Testimony / Attribution Not Verified\n### Layer 2: Psychological and Narrative Effect\nCombines shock imagery... Designed for high virality... → Judgment: This is a high-impact narrative trap..."
