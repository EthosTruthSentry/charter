## 📌 Motif Entry: “Absence as Virtue”

**Detected In:** Scenario Log 002  
**Claim Context:** Immigration narrative suggesting civic improvement via undocumented departure  
**Framing Pattern:**  
- Falsehood framed as systemic relief  
- Uses zero-sum logic: fewer immigrants = better outcomes  
- Amplified by macro-influencers and partisan nodes

**Inversion Strategy:**  
- Refuted with evidence from DHS, KFF, NCES  
- Reframed as motif, not metric  
- Verdict: Misleading and Unverified

**Reuse Potential:** High — motif likely to recur in future immigration or public benefit claims

## 🧠 Notes for Future Expansion

- Add motif taxonomy (e.g., fear-based, scarcity-based, purity-based)  
- Link motifs to diagnostic IDs  
- Include inversion techniques (semantic, visual, rhetorical)  
- Track motif drift over time
