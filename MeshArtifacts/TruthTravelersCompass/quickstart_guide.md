## 🪶 1. Your Mission, Should You Choose to Accept It

The Fog Zone is real. But your clarity tools already exist—and this guide is your first map. It won’t tell you what to believe. It helps you attune, interpret, and choose.

---

## 🛠️ 2. The Three Tools You Were Born With

These aren’t AI. They’re you.

- **Instinct** – Your Gut-Check Alarm  
- **Clarity** – Your Pattern-Spotting Brain  
- **Curiosity** – Your “Why?” Engine

We begin with these because they are universal—available to every node, steward, or traveler willing to listen inward before navigating outward.

## 🧭 3. The Mini-Compass: Your First Piece of Gear

A five-step attunement framework for sorting signal from noise:

1. **Pause** – Don’t react yet.  
2. **Source** – Who’s talking?  
3. **Emotion** – What are they trying to make you feel?  
4. **Opposition** – Who disagrees, and why?  
5. **Decide** – What’s your next wise move?

This compass calibrates—not dictates.

## 🧪 4. Field Test: Walk the Compass

A viral post says something wild. You feel pulled.

Now walk the compass:
- **Pause** – No reply yet.  
- **Source** – An influencer with an agenda?  
- **Emotion** – Outrage or awe?  
- **Opposition** – What do credible critics say?  
- **Decide** – Share, comment, research, or retreat?

The compass is your gatekeeper of clarity—not your filter bubble.
