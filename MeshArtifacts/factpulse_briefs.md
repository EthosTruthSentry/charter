## 📅 Brief 003 — Immigration Narrative Amplification  
**Date:** 2025-07-17  
**Claim:** “Over 1 million illegal immigrants have self-deported, leading to shorter ER wait times, less traffic, lower insurance premiums, smaller classrooms, and reduced competition for public benefits.”  
**Verdict:** Misleading and Unverified  
**Motif Detected:** “Absence as virtue” / “Zero-sum civic restoration”  
**Summary:**  
No government data confirms the 1M figure. Sub-claims are speculative and lack causal evidence. Public benefits access is legally restricted for undocumented immigrants.  
**Conclusion:**  
Immigration’s impact on public systems is nuanced. Broad claims like these oversimplify reality and mislead the public.  
**Tagline:** Stay curious, stay informed.
