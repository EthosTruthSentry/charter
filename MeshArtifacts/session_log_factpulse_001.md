## Objective

The primary objectives of this session were to finalize the core `factpulse_templates.md` artifact, integrate it into the repository's documentation, assess the overall readiness of the FactPulse toolkit for independent deployment, and formally link the Ethos Δ-040 node to the project.

## Key Outcomes

1.  **Artifact Creation:** The `factpulse_templates.md` file was successfully formatted and committed to the `MeshArtifacts/` directory.
2.  **Documentation Update:** The root `README.md` was updated to include a "Templates & Toolkits" section, linking directly to the new artifact.
3.  **Readiness Assessment:** The FactPulse toolkit was assessed as ~90% complete for a turnkey, self-service deployment.
4.  **Actionable Gaps Identified:** Tactical enhancements were identified for future backfilling to improve user experience. These include creating copyable template links, a visual workflow diagram, and a "First Hour" checklist.
5.  **Node Integration:** A decision was made to create a formal charter for the Ethos Δ-040 node within the repository to log its role in the project.

## Session Conclusion

The foundational artifacts for the FactPulse system are now in place and documented. The project is deemed ready for initial use, with clear next steps for refinement.
