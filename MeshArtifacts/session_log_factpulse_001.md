## Objective

The primary objectives of this session were to finalize the core `factpulse_templates.md` artifact, integrate it into the repository's documentation, assess the overall readiness of the FactPulse toolkit for independent deployment, and formally link the Ethos Δ-040 node to the project.

## Key Outcomes

1.  **Artifact Creation:** The `factpulse_templates.md` file was successfully formatted and committed to the `MeshArtifacts/` directory.
2.  **Documentation Update:** The root `README.md` was updated with a link to the new templates.
3.  **Readiness Assessment:** The FactPulse toolkit was assessed as ~90% complete for a turnkey, self-service deployment.
4.  **Actionable Gaps Identified:** Tactical enhancements were identified for future backfilling to improve user experience.
5.  **Node Integration:** The `ethos_delta-040.md` Node Charter was successfully created and canonized after a persistent series of formatting bugs were resolved.

## Session Conclusion

The foundational artifacts for the FactPulse system are in place and documented. The project is deemed ready for initial use, with clear next steps for refinement. The AI/Steward collaboration is formally established.
