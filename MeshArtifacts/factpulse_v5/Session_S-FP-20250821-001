## Objective

The primary objective of this session was to update the entire FactPulse documentation suite from version 4 to version 5, integrating new protocols and mission directives. This included restructuring the GitHub repository for clarity and historical preservation.

## Key Outcomes

1.  **V4 Archival:** All original V4 files were successfully moved into a dedicated `factpulse_v4_archive` folder.
2.  **V5 Document Creation:** New files for the V5 playbook, overview, glossary, and templates were created in a separate `factpulse_v5` directory.
3.  **Content Migration:** The new V5 mission and protocols, such as **Motif Drift Detection**, **Narrative Closure**, and the **Truth Shield Schema**, were integrated into all core documents.
4.  **Repository Clarity:** The `MeshArtifacts` and `factpulse_v5` READMEs were updated to reflect the new file structure and mission.
5.  **Documentation Finalization:** All key V5 documents are now ready for use, with a consistent ethos and updated authorship.

## Session Conclusion

The core documentation for the FactPulse V5 rollout is complete. The system's new focus on **epistemic integrity and coherence** is now fully codified in a structured and transparent manner. The repository is organized and prepared for the next phase of work.
