# FactPulse Operational Phases - V5

**‚ÄúA civic engine for epistemic integrity. Built for coherence. Tuned for resilience.‚Äù**

FactPulse is a modular, AI-assisted **coherence engine** designed to detect, decode, and disrupt narrative distortions with semantic precision and public transparency. [cite_start]It transforms misinformation into teachable moments ‚Äî not just refutations, but restorations of symbolic and civic meaning [cite: 196-197].

## üß≠ Phase 1: Monitoring & Intake

### üß† Methodology: Tiered Entity Framework
Not all sources are treated equally. Each monitored entity is assigned to a tier based on its influence, velocity, and risk profile. This framework ensures analytical energy is focused where it matters most.
[cite_start]**Objective:** Detect and ingest emerging civic signals from diverse sources, proactively profiling them for strategic relevance before they fully circulate [cite: 240-242].
**Activities:**
* [cite_start]Normalize multimedia inputs (OCR, transcription)[cite: 245].
* Identify motif patterns and amplification vectors.
* [cite_start]**New:** Proactively tag claims for strategic relevance using a **Threat Actor Context Map** [cite: 262-263].
* [cite_start]**New:** Use **Automated Motif Drift Detection (DRIFTGLASS)** to flag known falsehoods re-emerging in an altered form [cite: 265-267].

#### üî∫ Tier NS: National Security / Executive Origin
* **Entities:** @POTUS, @VP, @WhiteHouse, @realDonaldTrump, @SecDef, @SecState
* **Rationale:** Highest potential for global impact
* **Protocol:** Real-time ingestion within seconds of publication

#### ü§ñ Tier 0: Synthetic / Bot Network Content
* **Entities:** Known botnets, automated accounts (e.g., @GlobalGuardBot)
* **Rationale:** Amplification velocity and artificial consensus
* **Protocol:** Pattern recognition across thousands of accounts

#### üåê Tier 1: Macro-Influencers
* **Entities:** >10M followers or domain-shaping influence (e.g., @elonmusk, @TuckerCarlson)
* **Rationale:** Can elevate lower-tier falsehoods instantly
* **Protocol:** High-priority keyword monitoring

#### üß† Tier 2: Mid-Tier Commentators & Analysts
* **Entities:** Journalists, academics, niche leaders (e.g., @MattTaibbi)
* **Rationale:** Influence within specialized communities
* **Protocol:** Regular domain-specific narrative analysis

#### üåä Tier 3: Public Ambient Discourse
* **Entities:** General social media, anonymous forums
* **Rationale:** Origin point for novel falsehoods (‚ÄúPatient Zero‚Äù)
* **Protocol:** Thematic keyword tracking and claim signature velocity
