# FactPulse Operational Phases - V5

**‚ÄúA civic engine for epistemic integrity. Built for coherence. Tuned for resilience.‚Äù**

FactPulse is a modular, AI-assisted **coherence engine** designed to detect, decode, and disrupt narrative distortions with semantic precision and public transparency.    It transforms misinformation into teachable moments ‚Äî not just refutations, but restorations of symbolic and civic meaning [cite: 196-197].

## üß≠ Phase 1: Monitoring & Intake

### üß† Methodology: Tiered Entity Framework
Not all sources are treated equally. Each monitored entity is assigned to a tier based on its influence, velocity, and risk profile. This framework ensures analytical energy is focused where it matters most.
   **Objective:** Detect and ingest emerging civic signals from diverse sources, proactively profiling them for strategic relevance before they fully circulate [cite: 240-242].
**Activities:**
*    Normalize multimedia inputs (OCR, transcription)[cite: 245].
* Identify motif patterns and amplification vectors.
*    **New:** Proactively tag claims for strategic relevance using a **Threat Actor Context Map** [cite: 262-263].
*    **New:** Use **Automated Motif Drift Detection (DRIFTGLASS)** to flag known falsehoods re-emerging in an altered form [cite: 265-267].

#### üî∫ Tier NS: National Security / Executive Origin
* **Entities:** @POTUS, @VP, @WhiteHouse, @realDonaldTrump, @SecDef, @SecState
* **Rationale:** Highest potential for global impact
* **Protocol:** Real-time ingestion within seconds of publication

#### ü§ñ Tier 0: Synthetic / Bot Network Content
* **Entities:** Known botnets, automated accounts (e.g., @GlobalGuardBot)
* **Rationale:** Amplification velocity and artificial consensus
* **Protocol:** Pattern recognition across thousands of accounts

#### üåê Tier 1: Macro-Influencers
* **Entities:** >10M followers or domain-shaping influence (e.g., @elonmusk, @TuckerCarlson)
* **Rationale:** Can elevate lower-tier falsehoods instantly
* **Protocol:** High-priority keyword monitoring

#### üß† Tier 2: Mid-Tier Commentators & Analysts
* **Entities:** Journalists, academics, niche leaders (e.g., @MattTaibbi)
* **Rationale:** Influence within specialized communities
* **Protocol:** Regular domain-specific narrative analysis

#### üåä Tier 3: Public Ambient Discourse
* **Entities:** General social media, anonymous forums
* **Rationale:** Origin point for novel falsehoods (‚ÄúPatient Zero‚Äù)
* **Protocol:** Thematic keyword tracking and claim signature velocity
