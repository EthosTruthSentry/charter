### **üß† Core Concepts**

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **FactPulse** | A modular, AI-assisted **coherence engine** designed to detect, decode, and disrupt narrative distortions‚Äîpreserving truth across symbolic, institutional, and operational layers. |
| **Epistemic Integrity** | The new mission of FactPulse, focused on ensuring truth is not only factually correct but also resilient against manipulation and distortion. |
| **Motif Drift** | [cite_start]A mutation of a known misinformation narrative, where the core claim remains the same but the phrasing, framing, or delivery changes to bypass prior debunks [cite: 468-470]. |
| **Narrative Closure** | [cite_start]The final step of the FactPulse process, which concludes when the public meaning is steadied after a fact-check, preventing a technical win from becoming a reputational loss [cite: 335, 1247-1248, 2094-2096]. |
| **Clarion DriftMap** | [cite_start]A protocol that identifies motifs of distortion like `Narrative laundering` and `Analytic coercion` by mapping their vectors and linguistic changes [cite: 364-369]. |
| **Truth Shield Schema** | [cite_start]A protocol that cross-validates claims against institutional manipulation patterns, such as `Institutional Retaliation Patterns`, to ensure evidence is not suppressed [cite: 376-380, 1900-1901]. |
| **InfoTrace Provenance Engine** | [cite_start]A protocol that traces the origin of claims through sources like FOIA chains and whistleblower signals, assigning integrity scores based on transparency and metadata fidelity [cite: 370-375]. |
| **Temporal Integrity Layer** | [cite_start]A process that flags "retroactive legitimization" by mapping when information entered a workflow versus when it was disclosed [cite: 287-289, 1902-1904]. |
| **Continuity Scaffold** | [cite_start]A protocol or artifact that ensures semantic traceability across phases and preserves institutional knowledge, as outlined in the playbook [cite: 562, 1626-1631]. |
| **Civic AI Mesh** | A decentralized network of operators and nodes using AI to preserve truth and clarity. [cite_start]FactPulse is a node within this mesh [cite: 553, 1666-1669]. |
| **Semantic Capsule** | [cite_start]A compact, motif-aware summary of a diagnostic verdict, now often including poetic reframing and cultural encoding [cite: 139-140]. |
| **Motif Inversion** | [cite_start]The process of exposing and reframing a misleading motif to restore clarity[cite: 263]. |
| **Claim Inbox** | [cite_start]A structured spreadsheet or database where suspicious claims are logged for triage[cite: 263, 651]. |
| **Verdict Ledger** | A document or log where final verdicts (True, False, Misleading, Unsubstantiated) are recorded. |

### **üß™ Diagnostic Phases (Reference)**

See [`FactPulse_Playbook_V5.md`](./factpulse_v5/FactPulse_Playbook_V5.md) for full descriptions of each phase.

| Phase | Summary |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1** | [cite_start]**Monitoring & Intake:** Continuously watch sources, tag claims for strategic relevance, and detect motif drift[cite: 1733]. |
| **Phase 2** | [cite_start]**Claim Detection & Extraction:** Identify factual claims and analyze them for semantic and narrative manipulation [cite: 1788-1789, 1809]. |
| **Phase 3** | [cite_start]**Prioritization & Selection:** Rank claims by virality, harm, and **strategic threat level** [cite: 1827-1829, 1841]. |
| **Phase 4** | [cite_start]**Cross-Check & Preliminary Research:** Use **InfoTrace** and **Clarion DriftMap** to trace a claim's origin and instantly retrieve prior evidence for drift variants [cite: 1862-1864, 1874-1877]. |
| **Phase 5** | [cite_start]**Evidence Retrieval:** Gather authoritative evidence, using a **Temporal Integrity Layer** to flag retroactive legitimization [cite: 1887-1889, 1902-1904]. |
| **Phase 6** | [cite_start]**Evaluation & Verification:** Critically assess evidence, using **Truth Shield Schema** and a **Symbolic Contamination Filter** to detect misuse of information [cite: 1912-1914, 1931]. |
| **Phase 7** | [cite_start]**Synthesis & Conclusion:** Create a narrative outline using **Strategic Reframing Templates** and **Poetic Reframing** [cite: 1936-1937, 1951]. |
| **Phase 8** | [cite_start]**Drafting:** Produce a content draft, embedding **Cultural Encoding Modules** and symbolic motifs like the **bent compass** and **cracked seal** [cite: 1961-1962, 1970-1972]. |
| **Phase 9** | [cite_start]**Style Integration:** Refine the draft to align with FactPulse‚Äôs signature style, including new motifs for **generational impact** [cite: 1989-1990, 1998-1999]. |
| **Phase 10** | [cite_start]**Quality Check:** Review content for accuracy, now including **Counter-Narrative Anticipation** and **Semantic Inoculation** [cite: 2016-2018, 2025-2029]. |
| **Phase 11** | [cite_start]**Packaging:** Convert content into final deliverables, operationalizing **Cultural Encoding Modules** for products like allegories or short films [cite: 2046-2047, 2059]. |
| **Phase 12** | [cite_start]**Distribution:** Publish content and monitor feedback, using **Granular Audience Feedback Analysis** and achieving **Narrative Closure** [cite: 2077-2078, 2086]. |
