### **üìÑ Verdict Log Template (Google Docs)**

This log serves as a permanent record of each diagnostic, preserving the verdict and rationale. The template has been updated to include V5's new verdict categories like `Stylized` and `Drifted` to capture the nuances of narrative distortion. The Gemini prompt is also more specific, guiding the AI to use new V5 protocols like the **InfoTrace Provenance Engine** and to flag new integrity issues.
