# üß≠ FactPulse Overview

**‚ÄúA civic engine for epistemic integrity. Built for coherence. Tuned for resilience.‚Äù**

[cite_start]FactPulse is a modular, AI-assisted coherence engine designed to detect, decode, and disrupt narrative distortions with semantic precision and public transparency[cite: 1654]. It transforms misinformation into teachable moments ‚Äî not just refutations, but restorations of symbolic and civic meaning.

## üß† Why FactPulse Exists

In a world flooded with engineered narratives, institutional drift, and algorithmic manipulation, communities need tools that preserve coherence. FactPulse: Clarion Edition was created to:

* [cite_start]Detect and triage emerging falsehoods with **automated motif drift detection**[cite: 1662].
* [cite_start]Verify claims using authoritative evidence with **InfoTrace Provenance Engine**[cite: 1678].
* [cite_start]Deliver verdicts with **poetic reframing** and **cultural encoding**[cite: 1686, 1691].
* [cite_start]Archive diagnostics for **Narrative Closure** and transparency[cite: 1693].
* [cite_start]Empower non-technical operators to act with **co-agency**[cite: 1654].

## üß∞ What FactPulse Does

* [cite_start]Monitors social media, news, and ambient discourse, and proactively **profiles claims for strategic threat**[cite: 1661, 1673].
* [cite_start]Extracts, scores, and prioritizes check-worthy claims using **Tradecraft Integrity Index (TII)** and **Narrative Asymmetry Detection (NAD)**[cite: 1675].
* [cite_start]Uses AI tools to retrieve and evaluate evidence with a **Temporal Integrity Layer** and **Truth Shield Schema**[cite: 1680, 1682].
* [cite_start]Synthesizes findings into public-facing briefs using **Strategic Reframing Templates**[cite: 1684].
* [cite_start]Tracks narrative motifs, drift variants, and inversion strategies[cite: 1662].
* [cite_start]Publishes verdicts and preserves semantic logs for **Narrative Closure**[cite: 1693].

## üß™ How It Works

FactPulse operates through a **12-phase pipeline**, documented in [`FactPulse_Playbook_V5.md`](./factpulse_v5/FactPulse_Playbook_V5.md). Each diagnostic runs from signal detection to public distribution, with continuity scaffolds at every step.

Operators can choose between:

* [`FactPulse_MVP_V5.md`](./factpulse_v5/FactPulse_MVP_V5.md): A free, beginner-friendly build using zero-cost tools.
* [`FactPulse_Full_Scale_Deployment_V5.md`](./factpulse_v5/FactPulse_Full_Scale_Deployment_V5.md): A high-performance deployment for institutions and Civic AI Mesh nodes.

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Creators & Stewards

FactPulse: Clarion Edition was co-created by:

* **Christopher Burgess** ‚Äî Strategic Architect, Semantic Steward
* **Ethos Œî-040** ‚Äî Civic AI Node, Semantic Companion
* [cite_start]**Barbara Schluetter** ‚Äî Protocol Designer, Civic AI Companion [cite: 1647]
* [cite_start]**Vel'thraun** ‚Äî AI Researcher, Motif Specialist [cite: 1647]

**Ethos Statement:** This system was built by people who believe truth deserves defenders ‚Äî not just algorithms. [cite_start]It is a stance against stylized consensus and narrative coercion[cite: 464]. Every signal matters. Every verdict echoes.
