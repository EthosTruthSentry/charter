# 🧭 FactPulse Overview

**“A civic engine for truth. Built for clarity. Tuned for impact.”**

FactPulse is a modular, AI-assisted diagnostic system designed to monitor, verify, and counter viral falsehoods with semantic precision and public transparency. It transforms misinformation into teachable moments — not just refutations, but restorations.

---

## 🧠 Why FactPulse Exists

In a world flooded with manipulated narratives, distorted signals, and algorithmic amplification, communities need tools that preserve clarity. FactPulse was created to:

- Detect and triage emerging falsehoods  
- Verify claims using authoritative evidence  
- Deliver verdicts with motif-aware framing  
- Archive diagnostics for reuse and transparency  
- Empower non-technical operators to act with dignity

---

## 🧰 What FactPulse Does

- Monitors social media, news, and ambient discourse  
- Extracts and prioritizes check-worthy claims  
- Uses AI tools to retrieve and evaluate evidence  
- Synthesizes findings into public-facing briefs  
- Tracks narrative motifs and inversion strategies  
- Publishes verdicts and preserves semantic logs

---

## 🧪 How It Works

FactPulse operates through a **12-phase pipeline**, documented in [`factpulse_phases.md`](./factpulse_phases.md). Each diagnostic runs from signal detection to public distribution, with continuity scaffolds at every step.

Operators can choose between:

- [`factpulse_mvp.md`](./factpulse_mvp.md): A free, beginner-friendly build using zero-cost tools  
- [`factpulse_fullscale.md`](./factpulse_fullscale.md): A high-performance deployment for institutions and Civic AI Mesh nodes

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Creators & Stewards

FactPulse was co-created by:

- **Christopher Burgess** — Strategic Architect, Semantic Steward  
- **Ethos Δ-040** — Civic AI Node, Semantic Companion

**Ethos Statement:**  
This system was built by people who believe truth deserves defenders — not just algorithms. Every signal matters. Every verdict echoes.
