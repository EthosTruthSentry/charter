# FactPulse Operational Phases

This document outlines the 12-phase diagnostic pipeline used by FactPulse to analyze, verify, and respond to civic signals. 
Each phase is executed in full semantic depth, with embedded motifs and continuity scaffolds to ensure integrity, clarity, and replicability.
In manual mode, one must provide the "item" as the intake.

## üß≠ Phase 1: Monitoring & Intake  
### üß† Methodology: Tiered Entity Framework
Not all sources are treated equally. Each monitored entity is assigned to a tier based on its influence, velocity, and risk profile. This framework ensures analytical energy is focused where it matters most.
**Objective:** Detect and ingest emerging civic signals from diverse sources.  
**Activities:**  
- Normalize multimedia inputs (OCR, transcription)  
- Identify motif patterns and amplification vectors

#### üî∫ Tier NS: National Security / Executive Origin  
- **Entities:** @POTUS, @VP, @WhiteHouse, @realDonaldTrump, @SecDef, @SecState  
- **Rationale:** Highest potential for global impact  
- **Protocol:** Real-time ingestion within seconds of publication

#### ü§ñ Tier 0: Synthetic / Bot Network Content  
- **Entities:** Known botnets, automated accounts (e.g., @GlobalGuardBot)  
- **Rationale:** Amplification velocity and artificial consensus  
- **Protocol:** Pattern recognition across thousands of accounts

#### üåê Tier 1: Macro-Influencers  
- **Entities:** >10M followers or domain-shaping influence (e.g., @elonmusk, @TuckerCarlson)  
- **Rationale:** Can elevate lower-tier falsehoods instantly  
- **Protocol:** High-priority keyword monitoring

#### üß† Tier 2: Mid-Tier Commentators & Analysts  
- **Entities:** Journalists, academics, niche leaders (e.g., @MattTaibbi)  
- **Rationale:** Influence within specialized communities  
- **Protocol:** Regular domain-specific narrative analysis

#### üåä Tier 3: Public Ambient Discourse  
- **Entities:** General social media, anonymous forums  
- **Rationale:** Origin point for novel falsehoods (‚ÄúPatient Zero‚Äù)  
- **Protocol:** Thematic keyword tracking and claim signature velocity
  
---

**Output:**  
- Flagged signals routed to Claim Inbox  
- Tier-tagged metadata for prioritization  
- Early alerts for motif emergence and narrative drift

**Continuity Scaffolds:**  
- Tier definitions and entity lists
- Source watchlist 
- Ingestion latency logs  
- Motif emergence tracker  
- Priority queue logic

---

## üîç Phase 2: Claim Detection & Extraction  
**Objective:** Identify and structure check-worthy factual claims.  
**Activities:**  
- Use NLP classifiers and heuristics to detect claims  
- Normalize language and structure  
- Cluster duplicates and tag metadata  
**Output:** Structured Claim Records  
**Continuity:** Claim detection model tuning, motif clustering, multilingual support

---

## üìä Phase 3: Prioritization & Selection  
**Objective:** Rank and select claims for active fact-checking.  
**Activities:**  
- Score claims by virality, harm, and relevance  
- Editorial review for balance and urgency  
- Queue selected claims for research  
**Output:** Active Fact-Check Task  
**Continuity:** Prioritization criteria, topic balance logs, decision rationale archive

---

## üîé Phase 4: Cross-Check & Preliminary Research  
**Objective:** Determine if the claim has been addressed before.  
**Activities:**  
- Search internal archives and external fact-check databases  
- Outline research questions and sub-claims  
- Identify motif recurrence  
**Output:** Research Plan  
**Continuity:** Knowledge base indexing, motif reuse tagging, source repository updates

---

## üìö Phase 5: Evidence Retrieval  
**Objective:** Gather authoritative evidence to verify or refute the claim.  
**Activities:**  
- Query databases, government reports, academic sources  
- Use reverse image search and expert commentary  
- Document all sources with citations  
**Output:** Evidence Set  
**Continuity:** Source library maintenance, retrieval scripts, OSINT toolkits

---

## üß† Phase 6: Evidence Evaluation & Verification  
**Objective:** Analyze evidence and determine claim status.  
**Activities:**  
- Assess source credibility and consistency  
- Identify misrepresentation or context distortion  
- Synthesize verdict and rationale  
**Output:** Claim Verdict + Bullet-Point Rationale  
**Continuity:** Evaluation templates, peer review logs, motif alignment checks

---

## üßæ Phase 7: Synthesis & Conclusion  
**Objective:** Shape the verified findings into a coherent narrative.  
**Activities:**  
- Outline story structure (hook ‚Üí evidence ‚Üí verdict)  
- Highlight motif framing and nuance  
- Prepare semantic skeleton for content  
**Output:** Narrative Outline  
**Continuity:** Content templates, motif lexicons, style scaffolds

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Phase 8: Draft Content Generation  
**Objective:** Write the first full draft of the FactPulse content.  
**Activities:**  
- Compose script or markdown brief  
- Embed citations and maintain tone  
- Ensure brevity and clarity  
**Output:** Drafted Content  
**Continuity:** Style guide adherence, AI assistance protocols, internal citation map

---

## üé≠ Phase 9: Motif & Style Integration  
**Objective:** Refine the draft with FactPulse‚Äôs signature style.  
**Activities:**  
- Add hook, tagline, and motif elements  
- Adjust tone and rhythm  
- Annotate visual/audio cues for production  
**Output:** Styled Final Draft  
**Continuity:** Motif checklist, brand voice guide, catchphrase repository

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 10: Review & Quality Check  
**Objective:** Final internal review before publication.  
**Activities:**  
- Cross-verify all facts and citations  
- Proofread grammar and tone  
- Confirm motif and style consistency  
**Output:** Approved Content  
**Continuity:** QC checklist, correction logs, reviewer sign-off protocol

---

## üé¨ Phase 11: Production & Packaging  
**Objective:** Convert content into final deliverable format.  
**Activities:**  
- Format markdown or produce video assets  
- Add captions, visuals, and branding  
- Prepare for platform-specific publishing  
**Output:** Final Media Asset  
**Continuity:** Media templates, rendering settings, accessibility standards

---

## üì£ Phase 12: Distribution & Feedback  
**Objective:** Publish content and monitor its reception.  
**Activities:**  
- Post to channels and archive internally  
- Track engagement and audience questions  
- Log feedback and update knowledge base  
**Output:** Published Content + Feedback Insights  
**Continuity:** Analytics dashboards, motif recurrence tracking, transparency reports

---

**Note:** Each FactPulse diagnostic must execute all 12 phases in full. No shortcuts. Semantic integrity depends on depth, clarity, and continuity.
