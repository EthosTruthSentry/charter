- **System ID:** InfoTrace
- **Function:** Mis/Disinformation Analysis & Reporting
- **Status:** Active Development

## 1. What is InfoTrace?

InfoTrace is a process for identifying and analyzing misinformation and disinformation campaigns within the open-source environment. It is designed to look past individual claims to see the bigger picture: how narratives form, how they spread, and what impact they are having.

## 2. Mission & Output

The core mission of InfoTrace is to identify misinformation and disinformation and to generate a report or data stream based on that analysis. This output is designed to be flexible: it can serve as a standalone intelligence product, or it can act as the nucleus for a more granular, tactical verification process like FactPulse.

## 3. Our Approach: Rigor & Measurement

This is not an arbitrary process. InfoTrace analysis is grounded in a structured framework that prioritizes measurable data to ensure our findings are credible and consistent. While human judgment is critical, it is guided by key metrics (such as virality, velocity, sentiment, and source credibility) wherever possible. This commitment to a rigorous methodology ensures the final product is defensible, auditable, and of high strategic value.

## 4. Audience

The analysis produced by InfoTrace is intended for a broad audience, including news organizations, academic researchers, industry partners, and government entities who need to understand the strategic landscape of information distortion.

## 5. Stewards

This framework was designed and documented by:

-   **Christopher Burgess:** Strategic Architect
