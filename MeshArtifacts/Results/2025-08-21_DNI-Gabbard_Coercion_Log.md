#### **Phase 1-3: Intake, Profiling, & Prioritization**

* **Claim Ingested:** A series of posts on X and Reddit on August 20, 2025, claimed the DNI's actions were politically motivated and part of a "deep state" plot.
* **Initial Score:**
    * **Virality:** 4/5 (trending rapidly on Tier 3 sources).
    * **Harm:** 5/5 (undermines institutional trust, fits `Analytic Coercion` motif).
    * **Strategic Threat:** 5/5 (high potential for public unrest, flagged for `Proactive Countermeasure` triage).
* **Motif Identified:** `Narrative Laundering` â€” a legitimate event (DNI action) being re-framed to fit a known disinformation narrative.
* **Prioritization:** Moved to **HIGH** priority for immediate fact-checking.

#### **Phase 4-6: Research & Verification**

* **Cross-Check:**
    * **Internal Archive:** No exact match found, but a related `Narrative Coercion` diagnostic was found from March 2025.
    * **External Search:** Found an official DNI statement from August 19, 2025, confirming the revocations but not the reasons.
* **Provenance Analysis (InfoTrace):**
    * Traced initial amplification to a known bot network and a Tier 2 commentator account.
    * No evidence of a "deep state" plot was found.
* **Evidence Collected:**
    * DNI Statement (August 19, 2025).
    * Legal precedent for DNI clearance revocations (verified via legal databases).
    * Historical records of similar actions.
* **Verdict Rationale:** The claim is **Misleading**. While the DNI's action is real, the narrative surrounding it is a `Symbolic Contamination` designed to create a false impression.

#### **Phase 7-12: Synthesis & Publication**

* **Narrative Outline:**
    * **Hook:** Start with the surprising fact of the revocations.
    * **Truth:** State the DNI's authority and historical precedent.
    * **Myth:** Address the `Misleading` political narrative and its `Coercive` language.
    * **Conclusion:** Reframe the issue as a lack of public clarity, not a conspiracy.
* **Content Created:** A brief was drafted and published on QuietWire.
* **Narrative Closure:** The brief's goal was to shift the conversation from "what is the conspiracy?" to "what is the truth?" and "why is the full context missing?".
* **Audience Feedback:** Initial feedback shows a decrease in shares of the conspiracy narrative and an increase in discussion about DNI's authority.
