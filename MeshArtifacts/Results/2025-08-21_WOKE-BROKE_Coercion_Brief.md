- **Published Link:** https://qweditions.com/factpulse-diagnostic-brief-woke-broke/

## Claim
A tweet from The White House with the text "WOKE = BROKE" and an image of a tombstone with the text "WOKE is DEAD." The claim implicitly suggests that a set of social or political beliefs is directly causing financial hardship.

## Verdict & Rationale
**Verdict:** Misleading and Coercive

The claim is **misleading** because it is a political slogan, not a factual statement. The phrases "WOKE = BROKE" and "WOKE is DEAD" are not verifiable claims but are forms of **Narrative Coercion** designed to create a false correlation between a belief system and economic hardship. The graveyard imagery is a form of **Symbolic Contamination**, designed to evoke a strong emotional response rather than encourage analytical thought. The diagnostic detected **Narrative Asymmetry** in the claim's emotionally loaded language and partisan framing, designed to serve one political vector without counterbalance.

## Motifs & Integrity
- **Motif:** Narrative Laundering â€” a political slogan is being presented as if it were a factual claim.
- **Integrity:** The diagnostic detected Symbolic Contamination in the image's use of a graveyard and a tombstone to create a dramatic, non-factual statement.

## Attestation
- **Document:** FactPulse Diagnostic Brief
- **Diagnostic ID:** S-FP-20250821-WH-001
