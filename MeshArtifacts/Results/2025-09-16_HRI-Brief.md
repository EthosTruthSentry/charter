### **Claim**
A Reuters report claims the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) advisory from August 20, 2025, found undocumented cellular radios in foreign-made solar inverters and battery management systems (BMS) used in U.S. highway infrastructure, suggesting a potential Chinese sabotage threat.

### **Verdict & Rationale**
**Verdict:** `Likely True`
The FHWA does report undocumented radios in foreign-manufactured devices, and evidence from a May 2025 Reuters report confirms their presence in Chinese-made inverters, with China holding a 78% market share. This makes a Chinese origin highly probable. However, the advisory’s vague "foreign-made" label and lack of public proof of sabotage leave a slight gap, justifying "Likely True" over "Fully True."

### **Motifs & Integrity**
* **Motif:** `Framing Drift` — The claim evolved from a technical security note to a narrative of Chinese sabotage, amplified by geopolitical tensions.
* **Integrity:** The diagnostic flagged `Symbolic Contamination` where the "Chinese threat" framing may overshadow analytical clarity, though evidence supports the core issue.
