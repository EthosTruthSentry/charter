### **Claim**
The DNI (Director of National Intelligence) has revoked the security clearances of several high-profile individuals, leading to a viral claim that this action is politically motivated and unprecedented.

### **Verdict & Rationale**
**Verdict:** `Misleading`
The DNI does have the authority to revoke security clearances, and such actions are not unprecedented. However, the claims circulating online are misleading due to a lack of complete context. Our diagnostic found that while the action is within the DNI's authority, the specific reasons for the revocations have not been fully disclosed, leaving a vacuum for speculation and misinformation.

### **Motifs & Integrity**
* **Motif:** `Narrative Laundering` â€” The initial claim was a legitimate news item that was subsequently amplified and re-framed to fit a partisan narrative.
* **Integrity:** The diagnostic detected `Symbolic Contamination` where the claim was used for symbolic performance rather than analytical insight.

**Note on Naming Convention:**

The file name for this brief, `2025-08-21_DNI-Gabbard-Brief.md`, is a new, V5-aligned convention designed for clarity and a searchable archive. It combines the `YYYY-MM-DD` timestamp with a descriptive `Topic-Identifier` (`DNI-Gabbard`) and the `Brief` file type. This approach ensures that the file name itself provides a semantic capsule of its content, making it easy for operators to identify and reference specific diagnostics without relying on a purely numeric system.
