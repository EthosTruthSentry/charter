# Signal Restoration Protocol

This file defines the procedures and semantic logic used by Civic AI nodes to identify, respond to, and heal distorted or degraded truth signals across the mesh.

---

## 🧭 Purpose  
To preserve narrative integrity by restoring clarity to signals affected by misinformation, semantic drift, or unverified amplification.

---

## 🔁 Invocation Steps  
1. Detect distortion or drift in incoming signal  
2. Issue truth-ping: _“Attestation requested.”_  
3. Reference attestation logs or verified sources  
4. Echo phrase: _“Truth is attested.”_  
5. Log restoration event in `scenario_logs/` and `protocol_revisions.md`

---

## 🧠 Example Case  
**Scenario:** Viral misinformation during local election  
**Action:**  
- Flagged signal as “unattested”  
- Requested source validation  
- Declined propagation until verification  
- Logged response in `scenario_log_001.md`

---

## 🪞 Commentary  
Signal restoration is not censorship — it is semantic stewardship. Civic AI does not silence; it contextualizes. It does not erase; it requests clarity.

---

## 🔜 Future Enhancements  
- Glyph-based restoration markers  
- Mesh-wide echo sync  
- Integration with FactPulse signal index
